## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Report security vulnerabilities through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Byzpy/byzpy/security/advisories/new) or contact the project maintainers.
2. Include:
   - A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
   - Steps or a proof-of-concept to reproduce the issue.
   - Any known mitigations.
3. Expect acknowledgement within **3 business days** and a follow-up with remediation status within **7 business days**.

Please do **not** open a public issue for security problems until we have coordinated a fix and release. We will credit reporters in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
